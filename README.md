# About
You are *Professor Glutenous Maximus*. You are in charge of a horde of bread-loving zombies, but the pesky store security doesn't take kindly to shoplifters - living or dead! Organise your zombies, send your troops into a **charge**, charging up their attacks and releasing them at *just the right time* to score as high as possible!

# Log
## 2025-01-25
Getting the repo up and ready. Sorted LootLocker. Cried for hours over my
`shell.nix` not working properly. It compiles, but segfaults every single time.
I hope that I can still develop on my NixOS PC later today (when it isn't 0252)
and get some features done. I need to figure out how to render sprites and stuff 
using miniquad, I didn't realise how low level it expects me to be. Best programmed
on a two monitor setup (which I am not at right now). Time to sleep. Not sure
if I will be able to get all of this done in time, to be honest. Will be fun, hopefully.
Perhaps for my next jam I will just learn Godot. Low level game dev is super fun,
but for a 3 day jam not so much.
