# About
You are *Professor Glutenous Maximus*. You are in charge of a horde of bread-loving zombies, but the pesky store security doesn't take kindly to shoplifters - living or dead! Organise your zombies, send your troops into a **charge**, charging up their attacks and releasing them at *just the right time* to score as high as possible!
